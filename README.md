## Usage:
Simply go to:

This process is completely automatic if you have a GIRAFFE.yml file in the root of your repository that points to the relevant tool files in this repository. Documentation will follow. 

## Work In Progress
This application is actively being developed and in the future will support
* Visualisations of workflows
